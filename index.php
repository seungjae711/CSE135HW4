        <p>Technology ("science of craft", from Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand"; and -λογία, -logia[2]) 
            is the collection of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or 
            in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, 
            processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their
             workings. Systems (e. g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, 
             and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems.</p>

        <p>Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which,[1] through casual or organised participation, 
            aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some 
            cases, entertainment for spectators.[2] Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to 
            those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such 
            as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match)
             is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single 
             winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a 
             tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, 
             followed in some cases by playoffs.</p>

        <p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the 
            largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition,[3] and other organisations 
            such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports.
            [2] However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic 
            Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports 
            federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi,[4][5] and limits.
             the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.
